# <a href='https://github.com/Johanklemantan/Shopee-Email-Campaign-Prediction'> Project 1 : Email Campaign Prediction</a><br>
- Create a classification model that able to save estiamtion budget for advertisement about 74% monthly to help marketing team send promotion advertisement only to customer who will likely to read it<br>
- Engineered features to help indentify the behaviour of the customer<br>
- Visualize the data using seaborn and matplotlib<br>
- Optimized the data using Linear Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classifier Model, RepeatedStratifiedKFold, GridsearchCV, and threshold changing to reach best model<br>
- Deploy model for user using Flask

Results :  <br>

# <a href='https://github.com/Johanklemantan/Delivery-Truck-Ontime-Delay-Prediction'> Project 2 : Delivery Truck On-Time / Delay Prediction</a><br>
- Create a model that able to predict whether the delivery will be delayed or on time <br>
- Decide top 10 factors that has the highest ratio to determine the delivery status. This is able to help business owner to focus on that 10 factors to reduce delay ratio <br>
- Optimized data using Gradient Booster Classifier, RepeatedStratifiedKFold and GridsearchCV to achieve best model with accuracy of 89% <br>

Top 10 factors that affecting delay of delivery : <br>
